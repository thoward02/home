Did you know the chromium browser can handle an entire 3D engine?
Yeah either did I until I built this! Now I do understand it's not triple A quality, but it's just a demo to show that 3D enviroments are possible in the browser. Perhaps one of you can take my example and go farther with it <3

# Install

Due to the large problem with CORS policies, I decided to build a small webserver to host the files, so in order to run my program you'll need two things 
- Node.js installed
- Basic understanding of Npm // cmd (or what ever terminal you're using)

After that install is easy as Cd'ing into the directory of downloaded repository, and running `npm install` and `npm start`

So if you installed it on `C:\Users\User\Downloads\home` you would open CMD and do `cd C:\Users\User\Downloads\home` then run the two commands above

# Running
`npm start` starts your program, so once you see `[ -- Started --]` the program will be running on `127.0.0.1/PlayHome` So you just open that url in your browser and boom you're there.
